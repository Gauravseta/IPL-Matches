************* Known Issues ********************************

1.Live Match Section is confusing to me hence did not simulated anything.
  A section for Live Match is given on top, but I am confused where to bring data for Live match.
  Given the csv files, have tried to make full use of it.
2.Due to Time limitation,Look of the ui may not be good, but has tried to improvise as much possible.
3.Many texts which shall be bold are not made bold as concentration is much given to angular Coding and best practises.
4.Match Details Page does not show all fields of Object only few are made to render on UI.
5.Identation may not be proper due to IDE mismatch.Request to ignore at few, though atmost care is taken.
6.On Match details, after clicking innings button, button is not highlighted to let user know which button is clicked.
